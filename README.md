## Basic Login System Made in Python

I made a basic login and register system in python, currently it saves the users to a json file which is stored locally. There is a admin panel and some commands which I added to make some stuff easier. To login to the admin panel just type "-a -log" and enter a admin "username" and "password" which is "root" and "root123!".

 -I know code has some issues I'll refactor the code and make it smaller in the future.
 
 -I'll also make a system to encrypt the passwords in the future.
